# **Brian Tang**

I am a senior software engineer plumbing the depths of Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) and Data Engineering.

I have experience deploying machine learning infrastructure for small and large organisations: from dealing with the nitty gritty of Kubernetes and autoscaling, to optimising database queries and algorithms leveraging CUDA (via the Numba API).

You can get in touch with me via [[LinkedIn]](https://linkedin.com/in/ashrielbriantang) or [[email]](mailto:ashrielbrian.uom@gmail.com), and I tinker at [[Github]](https://github.com/ashrielbrian).
